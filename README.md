- 👋  Hi, I’m Kayla Elortondo (@kelortondo). I have previously worked as a Physician Assistant in neurology, before pivoting to software development. I am interested in projects which can leverage my experience as a health care provider to develop applications for improving healthcare outcomes and delivery. I am also interested in game development, renewables, automation, and AR/VR. Increasing the presence of women and empathy in the tech sector is a passion of mine.
